- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grant @gbwiersum

I'm a research tech with Northwestern University's Center for Structural Genomics of infectious diseases.
I split my time between bench-research and developing new research tools. 

I currently work with python-based machine learning and data science such as Numpy, Scipy, Tensorflow and Keras as well as Biopython.

Check out my github and let me know if you'd like to work together by emailing me at: gbwiersum@gmail.com
